# projeto-dweb
A project developed for my web development class's Q1 final exam. 

We had to develop each a website written exclusively in HTML with CSS & JavaScript. We had to make a website with 5 pages:
  * Main page:
      This would feature a basic introduction to who we are and our projects.
  * About me:
      This about me page would feature a brief summary of ourselves from a personal perspective, rather than a professional profile.
  * Exercises:
      We would have to compile all of the work we had done thus far into a single page, showing all of the tables and other components that we'd learned how to build.
  * Curriculum:
      A link to our Lattes curriculum.
  * Special project:
      This was a 100% customizable page that was up for us to decide what to do with. I chose a top things in outer space list. Cheesy.
